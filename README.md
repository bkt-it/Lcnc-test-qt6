Used on QT6.7.3 and QTCreator 14


I used Linuxcnc-source-dir as rip-install forlder

With Linuxcnc-dev (download in same way than Linuxcnc-source-dir) is used for create .deb package and istall linuxcnc and linuxcnc-dev .deb package.


Linux cnc work perfect, ethercat better than in the past .... but have difficult with task.cc linkage ... seems on my liblinuxcnc.a library is not present ...... 


These project make nothing .... only create for check if all is ok.
